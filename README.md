<h1>
  The Tiny Hardships of a Squirrel</h1>
<p>
  This is a project I started working on by myself, while I had started many prototypes of games, I had never been able to finish a game on myself. The progress is well underway, while not revolutionary in any way, this game feels good to play, has a fun gameplay ideas and is well polished and play-tested. All art and programming was done by me. The most significant ongoing process is the addition of a soundtrack. </p> 
<p>
  While currently unfinished, I hope that anybody who gets to play this game will enjoy doing so.
